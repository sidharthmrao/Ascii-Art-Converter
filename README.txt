Converts images to ASCII ART.

Has difficulty with very complicated or very high resultion images. Needs more testing.  
To run it, just replace the `image` variable in the python file with the file name of what you want to convert.
The current ascii text is scaled down to 10 percent the size of the original image. This can be changed by modifying the `scale_percent` variable.
